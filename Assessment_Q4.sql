/*
 * Question 4: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation
 * 
 * Objective:
 * Estimate CLV based on savings behavior and user tenure since registration.
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - Created CTE (customer_transactions) to calculate:
 *   * Total savings transactions per user
 *   * Total confirmed_amount value
 * - Created CTE (customer_tenure) to calculate:
 *   * Tenure in months (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, date_joined, CURDATE()))
 * - Merged datasets via JOIN on owner_id/id
 * - CLV Formula:
 *   (transactions/month) * 12 * 0.1% * avg_transaction_value
 *   Implementation:
 *   (total_transactions/tenure_months)*12*0.001*(total_value/100)
 * - Applied:
 *   * ROUND() for currency precision
 *   * NULLIF() to prevent division by zero
 * 
 * Challenges:
 * - Fixed column mismatch from customer_id alias
 * - Resolved NULL names via secondary users_customuser join
 * - Ensured Koboâ†’Naira conversion (/100)
 * - Safely handled zero-tenure cases with NULLIF */
